## Purpose
This software creates dungeons akin to those in Rogue (1980). The dungeons aren't playable, they're merely visually generated.

## Usage
Open the `Rogue.exe` file. Once in the menu, you can use the following commands:
- `[G]` to generate a new dungeon.
- `[S]` to generate a new dungeon, step-by-step.
- `[Esc]` to quit the program.
